Project 1 Analysis of Algorithms Summer 2015

This program is implementation of maximum sub array problem using 4 different algorithms to do running time analysis for these 4 algorithms.
HOW TO USE: There are 4 files needed for this program.
1.  max_sub_array.py  : This is python module contains a pyhton object MaxSub. All the 4 algorithms are methods of this object.
2.  test.py   : This is python script which tests the correctness of all 4 algorithms and saves the results in file                 MSS_Results.txt. The input is given from file MSS_Problems.txt.
3.  time_analysis.py   : This is python script which calculates the running for each algorithm for 10 different sizes from 100      to 1000. Each array size has 10 runs with different random values and then average is taken. The results will be saved in       file Time_Results.txt
4.  MSS_Problems.txt   : This is text file which will be used in test.py for input. It can contain python lists                 separated by newline.
